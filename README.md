# Banned Members
Through the 'Banned Members' script, you will be able to add the banned members, either in your own game or through Discord.

# Why Banned Members?
"Banned Members" will give you complete control over displaying the banned list, as it was previously explained, through which you will be able to allow the work team to fully control the banned list, and also the corrections feature is available according to the team ranks, for example: an observer in training, a general responsible for the ban.

# Is it open source?
Yes, the script is open source, but I will not allow you to delete my rights, and if you want to modify it and want to add your name, you can add it, provided that the rights are not deleted!
